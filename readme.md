This project is an **A.I. competition** between CSULA graduate students to implement Mars Swarm Robots to explore and collect hidden minerals on the Martian surface.  
Mars surface consists of **soil, sand**, and **rock** - depending on the Swarm Bot's wheel, it can/cannot move through them.  
Rovers are able to communicate through [communication server][1], by collectively helping each other discover the map and hidden minerals.

Please check the [demo video][2]
