This project is an A.I. competition of Mars Swarm Robots to explore and collect hidden minerals on the Martian surface.
Mars surface consists of soil, sand, and rocks - depending on the Swarm Bot's wheel, it can/cannot move through them.
Rovers are able to communicate through [communication server][1], by collectively helping each other discover the map and hidden minerals.

Please check the [demo video][2]
